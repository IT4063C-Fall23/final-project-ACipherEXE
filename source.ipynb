PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: I GOT STUCK ON MY DRIVEWAY, ON PAVEMENT, IN A STEEP SECTION OF THE ROAD. TC KEPT CUTTING THE THROTTLE. HERE'S WHAT I DID:  1) I TRIED TO USE THE BRAKES TO KEEP THE CAR FROM ROLLING DOWN THE HILL AND TO STOP THE NO-TRACTION WHEEL FROM SPINNING. THIS DID NOT WORK. TC KICKED IN, OVER AND OVER, CAUSING THE CAR TO ROLL BACKWARDS.  2) I TRIED TO USE THE BRAKES, DURING QUICK FOOT SWAP OF THE PEDALS (SEPARATE APPLICATION OF BRAKE, THEN GAS PEDAL). THIS TOO, DID NOT WORK. THIS WAS THE WORSE CASE - THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARD, AND THEN MADE THE DRIVERS SIDE WHEEL SPIN EVEN MORE (BESIDE, I NOW WAS ALMOST OFF THE ROAD, AND INTO MUDDY DITCH).  3) NEXT, I TRIED MORE CAREFUL SLOW ACCELERATION, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDLE, OFF-IDLE AND THE VERY SLIGHTEST OF ACCELERATION (NEEDED MORE GRANULARITY). THE WHEEL SPUN FREELY. I NOW WAS EVEN CLOSER TO BEING, OFF THE ROAD, AND INTO THE MUDDY DITCH. WHERE OTHERS HAVE FALLEN BEFORE.  4) FINALLY, I TURNED THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF. THIS HAD NO EFFECT. IT APPEARS THIS IS DUMMY-BUTTON (ITS FAKE).  HERE'S WHAT I EXPECTED...   A) SINCE 3 OF THE WHEELS REPORTED 0-MPH, AND EACH APPLICATION OF THE THROTTLE RESULTED IN NEGATIVE MPH, ON THE SAME 3 WHEELS THEN THE TC SHOULD ALLOW LOW MPH OF WHEEL SPIN, WHILE GAS AND BRAKES ARE APPLIED (I DO THIS ALL THE TIME IN REVERSE/ BACKING UP HILL, AND THIS WORKS GOOD - NO TC INTERFERENCE).  B) OR, SINCE 3 OF THE WHEELS REPORTED 0-MPH, AND EACH APPLICATION OF THE THROTTLE RESULTED ZERO FORWARD PROGRESS, THEN THE ABS SHOULD APPLY SLIGHT BRAKES (MAYBE EVEN HILL HOLDING FUNCTION), TO THE FRONT WHEELS, TO FORCE TRACTION TO THE WHEEL WITH THE MOST GRIP. ABS POSSIBLY APPLYING, ALTERNATING BRAKING, AS TRACTION IS LOST, AND GAINED, TO EACH FRONT WHEEL, TILL FORWARD MOTION IS ACHIEVED FOR 100FT (SOME DISTANCE).

MINOR GAS PEDAL VIBRATION NOTICED FOR FIRST 500 MILES DURING BREAK-IN.    DETAILS:  I WAS DRIVING ACCORD 2012 LX ON A LOCAL MAIN STREET AT ABOUT 20 TO 25 MPH, ENTERING A NORMAL SMALL SLOPE. I SUDDENLY HEARD LOUDER ENGINE NOISE, AND NOTICED TACHOMETER GOING UP FROM BELOW 2K TO 3K RPM QUICKLY. AT THE SAME TIME, I FELT GAS PEDAL WAS MOVING AWAY FROM MY RIGHT FOOT. EVENTUALLY THE GAS PEDAL CAME BACK AND TACHOMETER READING WENT BACK TO NORMAL AS WELL. THIS LASTED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS. I DID NOT MOVE MY RIGHT FOOT AWAY FROM GAS PEDAL AND DID NOT INTERVENE WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING. SINCE THIS SUDDEN ENGINE REV WENT AWAY IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS BY ITSELF, I DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE ACCORD ACCELERATED A LOT DURING THE PERIOD.    DURING FIRST 500 MILES ON THE ACCORD, I ALSO FELT MINOR GAS PEDAL VIBRATION FREQUENTLY ON ROADS THAT ARE NOT PERFECTLY PAVED AND HAVE SOME MINOR BUMPS. I HAVE NEVER NOTICED ANY SUCH GAS PEDAL VIBRATION ON OTHER CARS WHEN DRIVING DOWN ON THE SAME ROADS. THE VIBRATION BECAME LESS PRONOUNCED AFTER 500 MILES, AND I DIDN'T NOTICE IT LATELY.

THE OBJECT MADE MULTIPLE IMPACT STRIKES UNDER THE CAR FROM FRONT TO BACK AS EVIDENCED BY THE MARKINGS LEFT ON THE ALUMINUM COVERED INSULATION THAT COVERS THE UNDERCARRIAGE, ULTIMATELY STRIKING THE REAR AXLE, CAUSING IT TO BEND.  THE BEND IN THE AXLE IS FRONT-TO-BACK.  THIS IS NOT FROM BACKING OVER ANY OBJECT (SEE CAMPAIGN 14V656000). THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THE REAR AXLE AND TRAILING ARMS ARE EXPOSED  TO ROAD DEBRIS AND NOT OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND IMPACT AND SUBSEQUENT STRESS ON TRAILING ARMS.

THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS OF AQSIQ OF CHINA ARE AS FOLLOWS:  1. THE REAR TRAILING ARMS OF THE RECALL OF JETTA AND BEETLE OF VW CAUSED A DEFICIT. JUST WHEN ENCOUNTERING OBSTACLES IN REVERSING THE PROCESS, IT WILL CAUSE THE REAR TRAILING ARMS DEFORMED.  2. THE METHOD OF THE RECALL THAT INSTALLING A SHEET METAL CAN?T ELIMINATE DEFECTS. THE INSTALLATION OF A SHEET METAL ONLY ENHANCES THE RESISTANCE TO DEFORMATION OF THE REAR TRAILING ARMS, BUT WHEN THE MORPH TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THERE IS STILL THE RISK OF BREAKAGE AND LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. AFTER BREAKING, THE SHEET METAL DOES NOT NECESSARILY ALERT OF NOISE. IN THE CASE OF VEHICLES OF MORE THAN 40KM / H, WHEN THE REAR TRAILING ARMS FRACTURE, THE SHEET METAL WILL ALSO BREAK, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED.
