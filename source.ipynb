THIS WAS THE WORSE CASE - THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARD, AND THEN MADE THE DRIVERS SIDE WHEEL SPIN EVEN MORE (BESIDE, I NOW WAS ALMOST OFF THE ROAD, AND INTO MUDDY DITCH).  3) NEXT, I TRIED MORE CAREFUL SLOW ACCELERATION, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDLE, OFF-IDLE AND THE VERY SLIGHTEST OF ACCELERATION (NEEDED MORE GRANULARITY).

B) OR, SINCE 3 OF THE WHEELS REPORTED 0-MPH, AND EACH APPLICATION OF THE THROTTLE RESULTED ZERO FORWARD PROGRESS, THEN THE ABS SHOULD APPLY SLIGHT BRAKES (MAYBE EVEN HILL HOLDING FUNCTION), TO THE FRONT WHEELS, TO FORCE TRACTION TO THE WHEEL WITH THE MOST GRIP.

HONDA TELLS ME THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS WITH MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY NOTED WITH MY MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR, BUT JUST NOT WITH MINE IN PARTICULAR. I HAVE CALLED HONDA AMERICA AND PLEADED MY CASE WITH THEM AS WELL, AND THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO GO THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY, WHICH I DO NOT THINK IS APPROPRIATE. THERE HAS TO BE A DEFECT IN WITH THIS VEHICLE FOR THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY AT SUCH A LOW SPEED WITH A POTHOLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE POTHOLE WAS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, YET THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOY. SOMETHING IS JUST NOT RIGHT WITH THE CAR AND HONDA IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING IT. I ALSO TOLD HONDA I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR NOW, I FEEL THAT IF I HIT ANOTHER BUMP IN THE ROAD AN AIRBAG IS GOING TO DEPLOY. IT'S A SCARY SITUATION, BUT HONDA DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT IT. PLEASE BRING THIS CASE TO THEM, AS SOMEONE THERE IN UPPER MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO KNOW THAT THESE TYPES OF THINGS ARE GOING ON, AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE. THIS SHOULD BE REPAIRED AND COVERED COMPLETELY BY HONDA, AS I DID NOTHING WRONG, BUT LEFT WITH A BIG MESS AND A BIG BILL TO CLEAN UP.  PICTURES ATTACHED.

HE UNBUCKLED THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT THAT I HAD FASTENED HIM INTO HIS BOOSTER SEAT WITH A FEW HOURS EARLIER. BUT SOMEHOW THE SEAT BELT HAD GOTTEN TWISTED AROUND HIS WAIST WHILE IN HIS BOOSTER SEAT AND HE COULD NOT GET OUT.

THE SEAT BELT JUST KEPT GETTING TIGHTER, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UNBUCKLED AND THE ENGINE WAS OFF WITH THE KEYS OUT OF THE IGNITION AND IN MY HAND. MY GRANDSON WAS IN SERIOUS PAIN AND WAS STARTING TO HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING WHICH WAS MAKING HIM VERY ANXIOUS AND HYSTERICAL.

WHEN I REST MY HEAD TO THE HEAD REST, IT TOUCHES ONLY LESS THAN ONE CM TO THE HEAD REST. I CAN NOT LOWER DOWN THE HEIGHT OF HEAD REST BECAUSE THE BACK OF THE SEAT IS TOO HIGH. THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN NECK AND HEAD REST. I HAVE MADE A ROUGH SKETCH OF THIS SITUATION BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SEND IT TO YOU.  THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF THIS DESIGN IS THAT IF A SPEEDY CAR OR TRUCK HITS MY CAR IN THE BACK, MY HEAD WILL STOP WITH HEAD REST AND BODY WILL STOP WITH BACK OF SEAT BUT NECK, HAVING NO SUPPORT BACKWARD, WILL BENT AND MAY BE BROKEN AND ULTIMATELY MAY CAUSE OF DEATH.   I FAXED IT IN DETAILS TO HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE, TORRANCE, CA90501 ON 12/3/12 WITH SKETCH AND FAXED THREE TIMES EVERY WEEK. I ALSO ADVISED THEM TO MAKE AN EXPERIMENT: HAVE A DUMMY OF MAN MADE OF BROKEN GLASS, SEAT IT IN THE CAR, BUCKLE UP AND HIT THE CAR FORCIBLY IN THE BACK, THE NECK OF DUMMY WILL BE BROKEN. I TOLD THEM THAT THE CAR WAS GARAGED FOR THE LAST MORE THAN ONE MONTH AT 8024 MILES ODOMETER READING, TAKE THIS FAULTY CAR BACK AND RETURN MY MONEY. AFTER MORE THAN 40 DAYS, I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT MY CLAIM WAS REJECTED AS THE CAR WAS NOT FOUND FAULTY.

AFTER DRIVING THE CAR FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS I NOTICED SEVERE NECK AND SHOULDER PAIN.  NO SEAT ADJUSTMENT COULD ALTER THIS, I HAVE BECOME UNABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITHOUT SEVERE PAIN.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS FURTHER ONLINE(EVEN ON THIS WEBSITE FOR 2011)  THERE HAS BEEN A NUMBER OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.  I KNOW THERE ARE ALWAYS COMPLAINTS ABOUT CAR SEATS BECAUSE DRIVERS ARE ALL SO DIFFERENT, HOWEVER THE HONDA ACCORD HAS BY FAR THE MOST COMPLAINTS MANY OF ANY OTHER CAR.  *TR', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2012', 'productMake': 'HONDA', 'productModel': 'ACCORD', 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10444522, 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)', 'crash': True, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '01/17/2012', 'dateComplaintFiled': '01/19/2012', 'vin': '1HGCS2B81CA', 'components': 'SEAT BELTS', 'summary': 'WHILE DRIVING IN RAINY WEATHER IN TRAFFIC, MY 2012 HONDA ACCORD COUPE REAR ENDED ANOTHER HONDA ACCORD, I WAS GOING UNDER 20 MPH AND MY HEAD HIT MY STEERING WHEEL DUE TO SEAT BELT FAILURE.  *TT', 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2012', 'productMake': 'HONDA', 'productModel': 'ACCORD', 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10444414, 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '11/28/2011', 'dateComplaintFiled': '01/18/2012', 'vin': '', 'components': 'SEATS', 'summary': \"THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I'VE HAD WITH UNCOMFORTABLE SEATS..

MINOR GAS PEDAL VIBRATION NOTICED FOR FIRST 500 MILES DURING BREAK-IN.    DETAILS:  I WAS DRIVING ACCORD 2012 LX ON A LOCAL MAIN STREET AT ABOUT 20 TO 25 MPH, ENTERING A NORMAL SMALL SLOPE. I SUDDENLY HEARD LOUDER ENGINE NOISE, AND NOTICED TACHOMETER GOING UP FROM BELOW 2K TO 3K RPM QUICKLY. AT THE SAME TIME, I FELT GAS PEDAL WAS MOVING AWAY FROM MY RIGHT FOOT. EVENTUALLY THE GAS PEDAL CAME BACK AND TACHOMETER READING WENT BACK TO NORMAL AS WELL. THIS LASTED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS. I DID NOT MOVE MY RIGHT FOOT AWAY FROM GAS PEDAL AND DID NOT INTERVENE WHILE THIS WAS HAPPENING. SINCE THIS SUDDEN ENGINE REV WENT AWAY IN A COUPLE OF SECONDS BY ITSELF, I DIDN'T FEEL THAT THE ACCORD ACCELERATED A LOT DURING THE PERIOD.    DURING FIRST 500 MILES ON THE ACCORD, I ALSO FELT MINOR GAS PEDAL VIBRATION FREQUENTLY ON ROADS THAT ARE NOT PERFECTLY PAVED AND HAVE SOME MINOR BUMPS. I HAVE NEVER NOTICED ANY SUCH GAS PEDAL VIBRATION ON OTHER CARS WHEN DRIVING DOWN ON THE SAME ROADS. THE VIBRATION BECAME LESS PRONOUNCED AFTER 500 MILES, AND I DIDN'T NOTICE IT LATELY.    I AM NOT SURE IF THERE IS ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INITIAL GAS PEDAL VIBRATION DURING BREAK-IN AND RECENT ENGINE REV INCIDENT.    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT HIGHWAY SAFETY OF THE CAR. *TR\", 'products': [{'type': 'Vehicle', 'productYear': '2012', 'productMake': 'HONDA', 'productModel': 'ACCORD', 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)'}]}, {'odiNumber': 10436647, 'manufacturer': 'Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)', 'crash': False, 'fire': False, 'numberOfInjuries': 0, 'numberOfDeaths': 0, 'dateOfIncident': '11/01/2010', 'dateComplaintFiled': '11/21/2011', 'vin': '1HGCP2F36CA', 'components': 'SEATS', 'summary': 'HAVE HAD TO BLOCK SEAT RESTRAINT FROM WORKING DIGS INTO BACK CAUSING CONSTANT MOVEMENT WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE CAUSING TO NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO ROAD AHEAD.

THE OBJECT MADE MULTIPLE IMPACT STRIKES UNDER THE CAR FROM FRONT TO BACK AS EVIDENCED BY THE MARKINGS LEFT ON THE ALUMINUM COVERED INSULATION THAT COVERS THE UNDERCARRIAGE, ULTIMATELY STRIKING THE REAR AXLE, CAUSING IT TO BEND.  THE BEND IN THE AXLE IS FRONT-TO-BACK.  THIS IS NOT FROM BACKING OVER ANY OBJECT (SEE CAMPAIGN 14V656000). THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THE REAR AXLE AND TRAILING ARMS ARE EXPOSED  TO ROAD DEBRIS AND NOT OF SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO WITHSTAND IMPACT AND SUBSEQUENT STRESS ON TRAILING ARMS.

THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS OF AQSIQ OF CHINA ARE AS FOLLOWS:  1. THE REAR TRAILING ARMS OF THE RECALL OF JETTA AND BEETLE OF VW CAUSED A DEFICIT. JUST WHEN ENCOUNTERING OBSTACLES IN REVERSING THE PROCESS, IT WILL CAUSE THE REAR TRAILING ARMS DEFORMED.  2. THE METHOD OF THE RECALL THAT INSTALLING A SHEET METAL CAN?T ELIMINATE DEFECTS. THE INSTALLATION OF A SHEET METAL ONLY ENHANCES THE RESISTANCE TO DEFORMATION OF THE REAR TRAILING ARMS, BUT WHEN THE MORPH TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, THERE IS STILL THE RISK OF BREAKAGE AND LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. AFTER BREAKING, THE SHEET METAL DOES NOT NECESSARILY ALERT OF NOISE. IN THE CASE OF VEHICLES OF MORE THAN 40KM / H, WHEN THE REAR TRAILING ARMS FRACTURE, THE SHEET METAL WILL ALSO BREAK, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED.
