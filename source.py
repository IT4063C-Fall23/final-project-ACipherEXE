# # {Project Title}üìù
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# That there are cars that are recalled being sold. This could be a danger for others on the road and future owners. This could lead on to unessary deaths or owners being hurt. So I want the DMV to warn before the purchase of a used car or annoy the new owner to fix the car.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# How many cars are currently sold with defects in the US and how many reports of known problems are happening? 

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->
# 
# I belive a large amount of defect cars are being sold in the US and cars that have defects are still on the road. 

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# I will use the NHTSA dataset for defects for a list of what is going on.
# 
# Link:https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa-datasets-and-apis
# 
# I will used a automated dataset in kaggle that takes cars being sold in Craigslist because that is normally where owners sell their cars
# 
# Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data
# 
# 
# Plus figure out how many could have been hurt by these defects with the NHTSA

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->
# 
# First I want to concentrate of how many one popular brand and model of a certain year from each region US, Asian and Euro manufactures. Then look at each of their popular models and look for a list of defects that has been reported by the NHTSA. Then check how many are being on sale currently per state with the kaggle dataset. Then see how many reports of a model has been made by the last 5 years.

# That the Jetta has a total of 510 complaints. Thats crazy

# Checkpont 2:
# What have we have so far? 
# 
# That the f-150 was built tough and the accord and Jetta both have a large amount of complaints. But defect wise the ford only has 4 recalls, the honda and the volkwagen have 8. But there is a ton of all in the us with the data we got from cregslist. 
# 
# There is missing vins and other things but I think with a .dropna we can clean it up.

# Lets first build a map of all the cars in the us useing the long and lat.

# In[45]:


import folium
# There was NaNS in the df for lat and long
american_cars_on_sale.dropna(inplace=True)
euro_cars_on_sale.dropna(inplace=True)
asian_cars_on_sale.dropna(inplace=True)

map_object = folium.Map(location=[39.8283, -98.5795], zoom_start=4)
for index, row in american_cars_on_sale.iterrows():
    folium.Marker([row['lat'], row['long']], popup=row['model']).add_to(map_object)
for index, row in euro_cars_on_sale.iterrows():

map_object


# We can see clearly that these cars are still sold all around the US. So there is a high chance that a new owner could have these cars. Even in Alaska and Hawwaii.

# But suddenly I started thinking how many vins from the creglist can I find hits with complaints in the NHTSA?
# Because there is no complaints in the F-150 we will skip them

# In[69]:


map_object = folium.Map(location=[39.8283, -98.5795], zoom_start=4)

# Incredible but why is there none? According to NHTSA complaints are filed by users of the cars. So it was bad to assume this but they could be still roaming new users.
